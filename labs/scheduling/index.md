# Advanced Scheduling
## Node Affinity/Anti-Affinity 

Get list of nodes
```
kubectl get nodes 
```
You should have 3 nodes
```
NAME              STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
ip-10-0-100-102   Ready     <none>    2d        v1.9.0
ip-10-0-100-134   Ready     master    2d        v1.9.0
ip-10-0-100-70    Ready     <none>    2d        v1.9.0
```


Set a label on the last node 
```
kubectl label nodes <ip-10-0-100-70> disktype=ssd
```

Check to make sure node label was applied 
```
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```

```
NAME              STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION   LABELS
ip-10-0-100-102   Ready     <none>    2d        v1.9.0    beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/hostname=ip-10-0-100-102
ip-10-0-100-134   Ready     master    2d        v1.9.0    beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/hostname=ip-10-0-100-134,node-role.kubernetes.io/master=
ip-10-0-100-70    Ready     <none>    2d        v1.9.0    beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/hostname=ip-10-0-100-70
```

Update YAML with `nodeSelector`
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
```

Deploy application:
```
kubectl create -f manifests/ssd_pod.yaml
```

Confirm POD was assigned to node with label 

```
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

Now we are going to use `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` and `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` along with `weight` to customize where our Pods are deployed. 

First let's deploy our demo app using `node-affinity.yaml` and then check to see which nodes it was scheduled to. 
```
kubectl get pods
```

```
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
node-affinity-589d989958-8xtf9   0/1     Pending   0          13s
node-affinity-589d989958-b8hfg   0/1     Pending   0          13s
node-affinity-589d989958-d6hrq   0/1     Pending   0          13s
```

Well, they aren't being scheduled to any nodes.  Do some investigation and determine why. 

Once you have figured out why the Pods are not being scheduled resolve the issue and redeploy to 2 of your nodes.   

After confirming the Pods have been deployed successfully, apply the `preferred` label, to one of the nodes, and then delete the Pod replica running on the other node and you will see it get scheduled on to the node that now has 2 labels applied. 

Now if we check we can see that the Pod was deployed to the node with both labels applied. 
```
 kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP            NODE                                          NOMINATED NODE
node-affinity-589d989958-9q668   1/1     Running   0          1m    100.96.1.15   ip-172-20-55-161.us-west-1.compute.internal   <none>
node-affinity-589d989958-q7qhh   1/1     Running   0          1m    100.96.1.14   ip-172-20-55-161.us-west-1.compute.internal   <none>
node-affinity-589d989958-tnvlq   1/1     Running   0          1m    100.96.1.13   ip-172-20-55-161.us-west-1.compute.internal   <none>
``` 

## Cleanup
Delete nginx POD
```
kubectl delete pod nginx 
```

## Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity
### More Useful Example 
Kubernetes has built-in node labels that can be used without being applied manually first.

Interpod Affinity and AntiAffinity can be even more useful when they are used with higher level collections such as ReplicaSets, Statefulsets, Deployments, etc. One can easily configure that a set of workloads should be co-located in the same defined topology, eg., the same node.

## Always co-located on the same node
## Allow workloads to run on Master node. 
Prior to this lab we must remove the taint from the master so that workloads can run on it. 
```
kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-
```

In a three node cluster, a web application has in-memory cache such as redis. We want the web-servers to be co-located with the cache as much as possible. Here is the yaml snippet of a simple redis deployment with three replicas and selector label `app=store`. The deployment has `PodAntiAffinity` configured to ensure the scheduler does not co-locate replicas on a single node.

Deploy redis YAML
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/affinity.yaml
```

```
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1 
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis-cache
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: store
    spec:
      affinity:
        podAntiAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: app
                operator: In
                values:
                - store
            topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
      containers:
      - name: redis-server
        image: redis:3.2-alpine
```

The below yaml snippet of the webserver deployment has podAntiAffinity and podAffinity configured. This informs the scheduler that all its replicas are to be co-located with pods that have selector label `app=store`. This will also ensure that each web-server replica does not co-locate on a single node.

Now let’s deploy the YAML for web servers.

```
kubectl apply -f manifests/anti_and_affinity.yaml
```

```
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1 
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-server
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-store
    spec:
      affinity:
        podAntiAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: app
                operator: In
                values:
                - web-store
            topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
        podAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: app
                operator: In
                values:
                - store
            topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
      containers:
      - name: web-app
        image: nginx:1.12-alpine
```

After creating the above two deployments, our three node cluster should look like below.


|	node-1			|		node-2			|		node-3	|		
|	webserver-1		|	    webserver-2		|	  webserver-3 |
|	    cache-1		|		cache-2			|	      cache-3      |

As you can see, all 3 replicas of the web-server are automatically co-located with the cache as expected.

To confirm run: 
`kubectl get pods -o wide`

Best practice is to configure these highly available stateful workloads such as Redis with AntiAffinity rules for more guaranteed spreading.

## Simplified example
To help understand what just happened here is a simplified example of using `podAffinity` and `podAntiAffinity`. 

Start by looking in `02-affinity/manifests` and you'll see `pod-affinity.yaml`. This manifest creates 2 deployments, a simple demo application and a `redis` datastore. 

The manifest deploys `pod-affinity-1` without any special labels, but if you look at `pod-affinity-2` you'll see that it is required to run on the same node as `pod-affinity-1`.   

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pod-affinity-1
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: pod-affinity-1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: k8s-demo
        image: aslaen/k8s-demo
        ports:
        - name: nodejs-port
          containerPort: 3000
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pod-affinity-2
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: pod-affinity-2
    spec:
      affinity:
        podAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            - labelSelector:
                matchExpressions:
                  - key: "app"
                    operator: In
                    values:
                    - pod-affinity-1
              topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
      containers:
      - name: redis
        image: redis
        ports:
        - name: redis-port
          containerPort: 6379
```

Go ahead and create it
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/pod-affinity.yaml
```

Now if you go check the pods you will see they are running on the same node.  

Scale `pod-affinity-2` and confirm it ends up with `pod-affinity-1`
```
kubectl scale --replicas=4 deployment/pod-affinity-2
```

Delete the deployment 
```
kubectl delete -f manifests/pod-affinity.yaml
```

## Multi-zone Affinity
For a cluster that spans multiple zones you can use labels to schedule your apps into the same zone, or different zones. 

Look at one of the node's labels and you will find `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone`

Now update the `pod-affinity.yaml` file so that `topologykey` is: 
```
topologyKey: "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone" 
```

Redeploy and you will see the Pods are scheduled onto all the nodes because our cluster is only in one zone. 

You can also scale replicas to 5
```
kubectl scale --replicas=5 deployment/pod-affinity-2
```

Confirm Pods are scheduled correctly. 
```
kubectl get pods -o wide 
```

## Cleanup 
Delete the deployments 
```
kubectl delete -f manifests/pod-affinity.yaml
```


## Never co-located on the same node

In the same directory there is a `pod-anti-affinity.yaml` file 

Again we are deploying `pod-affinity-1` without any special labels, but this is not the case for our other 2 deployments. 

* Deployment `pod-affinity-2` is set to run on the same node as `pod-affinity-1`
* Deployment `pod-affinity-3` is set to run on a different node than `pod-affinity-1`.

Now deploy and confirm it works. 
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/pod-anti-affinity.yaml
```

You will now see that 4 deployments were created.  We are going to look at the first 3 and will touch on the 4th in a bit. 

For our 2 deployments we can see they were scheduled to the same node. 

For our 3rd deployment we can see that it was scheduled to a node that did not have `pod-affinity-1` running on it. 

Confirm that the Pods are scheduled as defined. 
```
kubectl get pods -o wide 
```

```

```


## Visual example 

Highly Available database statefulset has one master and three replicas, one may prefer none of the database instances to be co-located on the same node.

Using Anti-Affinity we can specify that each of the DB-REPLICAs will be on separate nodes.

|	node-1		|	node-2		|	node-3		|	node-4  |
|    DB-MASTER	 |   DB-REPLICA-1	 |   DB-REPLICA-2	 |    DB-REPLICA-3   |


## Cleanup
Delete deployments
```
kubectl delete deployment redis-cache web-server
kubectl delete deployment pod-affinity-1 pod-affinity-2 pod-affinity-3 pod-affinity-4 pod-affinity-5
```

# Taint and Tolerations Lab
Node affinity  is a property of pods that attracts them to a set of nodes (either as a preference or a hard requirement). Taints are the opposite – they allow a node to repel a set of pods. 

Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a node; this marks that the node should not accept any pods that do not tolerate the taints. Tolerations are applied to pods, and allow (but do not require) the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints.

You add a taint to a node using `kubectl taint`. For example: 
```
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule
```
places a taint on node `node1` The taint has key `key`, value `value`, and taint effect `NoSchedule`.
This means that no pod will be able to schedule onto node1 unless it has a matching toleration. 

You specify a toleration for a pod in the `PodSpec`. Both of the following tolerations “match” the taint created by the `kubectl taint` line above, and thus a pod with either toleration would be able to schedule onto `node1`:

```
tolerations:
- key: "key"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

```
tolerations:
- key: "key"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

NOTE: An empty `key` with operator `Exists` matches all keys ,values and effects which means it will tolerate everything. 
```
tolerations:
- operator: "Exists"
```

An empty effect matches all effects with a key `key`
```
tolerations:
- key: "key"
  operator: "Exists"
```

## Apply taint to node 
In this lab we will be applying a taint and then showing how only PODs with an exception are allowed to be scheduled on that node. 

## Get nodes 
`kubectl get nodes`

```
NAME              STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
ip-10-0-100-102   Ready     <none>    1d        v1.9.0
ip-10-0-100-134   Ready     master    1d        v1.9.0
ip-10-0-100-70    Ready     <none>    1d        v1.9.0
```

Apply a taint to the top node. 
```
kubectl taint nodes ip-10-0-100-102 dedicated=lab:NoSchedule
```

## Deploy nginx without toleration

```
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2 
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 3
  template: 
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

```
kubectl apply -f manifests/nginx_deployment.yaml
```

You’ll notice it does not get scheduled to the node we tainted above. 

## Update YAML to allow scheduling on tainted node. 
```
apiVersion: apps/v1beta2 
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-taint
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-taint
  replicas: 3
  template: 
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-taint
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "dedicated"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "lab"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
      containers:
      - name: nginx-taint
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

```
kubectl apply -f manifests/nginx_taint.yaml
```

## Confirm nodes are scheduled as expected
Now confirm only PODs in deployment  `nginx-taint` are running on tainted node. 
```
kubectl get pods -o wide 
``` 

You should see that PODs in deployment `nginx-deployment` are NOT scheduled on tainted node. 

```

kubectl taint nodes ip-10-0-100-102 dedicated-
```

## Cleanup
